We are using structure 3JBU. I combined the 2 pdb-like structures by using the 'cat' shell command. 

I cannot build the model in my computer because to successfully generate a topology, the system needs to be able to differentiate between lower and upper case. 

I also need to make some modifications to the structure:

1) Change the nascent peptide (chain z in 3jbu from combining bundle1 and bundle2)

2) ARG y  11 : This residues is not complete, thus I removed it

3)  Remove the terminal P, OP1, OP2, OP3 from chain A, X, a, b, v

4)  RNA chain a / residue A119

How to Prepare the nascent peptide??

I combined the tRNA from the 3JBU crystal structure, and the new model of the nascent peptide with the 'Fixed CIS backbone' (initial structure of WT from our current MD simulations).

What I MUST do is to renumber the tRNA numbering for chain v!! I am working on it in the following directory: 

/Users/fatima/Stanford/70S/test/3jbu-pdb-bundle/Build_tRNA

The file with renumbered tRNA is: tmp_v.pdb

I already combined the files into a single structure: ChV_tRNA_WTprot.pdb 

Now I have to insert protein+tRNA into the complete ribosome. This should be easy because the tRNA was taken directly from 3JBU
