## Steps to building the model of the _Escherichia coli_ ribosome stalled with the SecM arrest peptide from _Mannheimia succiniciproducens_

This study investigates the mechanism by which the 8 amino acid long _Mannheimia succiniciproducens_ (_Ms_) can interact with the PTC and ribosome exit tunnel (in this case of the _E.coli_ (_Ec_) ribosome tunnel) to effect translational stalling. 

The key issues and their solutions are listed as follows: 

1. There is no structure available for _Ms_ SecM, so we used a structure of a stalled ribosome by _Ec_ SecM. We chose structure [3JBU](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/3JBU), built after a cryoEM density map generated by [Zhang _et al_](https://elifesciences.org/articles/09684).  

2. Some of the peptide bonds in the 3JBU nascent chain (chain z) were in the _cis_ conformation and were substituted to _trans_ conformations (see [readme](https://github.com/fatipardo/BuildRibosomeModel) for the BuildRibosomeModel repo).

Below is the _E coli_ SecM sequence. The _cis_ peptide bonds in 3JBU are in **bold**: 

KLISE**ED**LFSTP**VW**ISQAQ**GI-RA**G

2. We also needed to substitute the _Ec_ SecM residues from the nascent peptide to _Ms_ SecM, to match our experimental system, and we used PyMOL to do this. 
Substitution of residues was done **before** fixing the _cis_ peptide bonds. The following serves to compare  the _Ec_ and _Ms_ SecM sequences, and hopefully highlights the residues that were substituted: 

```

Ec --KLISE**ED**LFSTP**VW**ISQAQ**GI-RA**G

Ms SGSGGSG**SG**SGSGS**GS**GSGHA**PI-RG**S

```

3. Some residues were "easy" to substitute. 
Just "flip" the oxygen of the NH (this can be done by manually changing the coordinates, but this is also how VMD "fixes" _cis_ bonds), followed by energy minimization to correct the geometry. 
For the other bonds, we decided to use KIC implemented in [Rosetta](https://www.rosettacommons.org/software) (also check directory that contains reference papers: ./SecM_Remodel_Ref_Papers/). We defined the loops as 4 residues centered at the _cis_ bond. 

The specific 'mover' used was genKIC (the same method for cyclic peptide modeling):

We generated many models and selected the ones with the best score. The bonds we fix this way are: ... and ...
