STEPS NECESSARY TO CREATE THE INDEX OF ATOMS IN THE TUNNEL

#######################################################################
### These first steps can only be done for the reference structures ###
### Once the make-index.sh script is generated, it can be reused    ###
### for all other systems, as we want the same residues filtered!   ###
#######################################################################

0. Create an initial reference structure. For this step I used the selection tools from VMD. 
   This allows me to visualize the selection and see if I like it or not. The problem is that 
   I do not get complete residues, as I am selection atoms within a certain radius. 

>> The file generated is: complete_tunnel_em.pdb

1. Cut the columns that contain info of chain and residue number, and sort for unique. This will
   give us the list of residues that we want. 

>> use this script do to this step: get_atom_list.sh

2. Once you have the output of the list, you can use that to create the script
   to make the index. This was all done by hand. We create one list
   per chain, each list contains only the residue numbers. The idea is to create 
   the commands to create the index, we can then have a separate command for each
   chain and we go through the residue numbers in the list. 

** NOTE: Here we also changed the name of the chains in the reference structure. The problem with 
   my current OS, is that it cannot differentiate between upper and lowercase :( so I have to change
   the name of some chains, so when we run 'gmx make_ndx' we get only the atoms for the specific chain
   we want. 

>> The chains that I changed are as follows:

   F -> 1
   h -> 2
   I -> 3
   W -> 4
   V -> 5 
   y -> 9 
 3LE -> ILE

>> You can use this script to change the names: ./change_name_chains.sh

** IMPORTANT ** YOU MUST CHANGE THE CHAIN NAME IN OTHER SYSTEMS (K13, N13, CONTROL) BEFORE RUNNING THE FINISHED SCRIPT 
I KEPT A NEW COPY OF THE REFERENCE IN THE FILTERING DIRECTORY, SO DO NOT MESS THE ORIGINAL 

>> Final script to generate index: get_atoms_for_index_alltunnel.sh

3. Filter reference structure:

echo '13\n q\n' | gmx trjconv -f em_nosol.pdb -s em_nosol.pdb -n index.ndx -o em_within15_tunnel.pdb

4. Filter trajectories!! Notice I have previously generated these scripts for the other systems, so we only need to 
   modify them to use the current files (new index file, change names of output files). 

>> filter_within15.sh 


That is all! Enjoy!!
